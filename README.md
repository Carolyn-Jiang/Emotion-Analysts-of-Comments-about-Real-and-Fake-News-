Emotion Analysts of Comments about Real and Fake News.

1. Introduction

Fake news refers to misinformation, disinformation, or malformation, which is spread through word of mouth and traditional media and more recentlythrough digital forms of communication such as edited videos, memes, unverified advertisements, and social media propagated rumors. Fake news spread through social media has become a serious social problem. In this paper, we want to study the emotional impact of fake news on people through comments under true and fake news. Identify the true and fake news by establishing a model.


2. Objectives and expected contributions

We hereby posit one research question, formalized in the following, and by leveraging the Fake and real news dataset and real news comments from internet to answer these questions: \
• Research Questions: How much influence can news have on people’s thoughts? And how much negative social impact can fake news cause? \
We expect this work can make the following contributions: \
• We provide a machine learning approach to identify the news and help people get the correct information from the internet. \
• Analyze the emotional impact of fake news on people, and formulate psychological interventions of misleading information to prevent it with the potential of it resulting in mob violence, suicides, etc., due to misinformation circulating on social media.

4. Method: Cleaning a 30, 000 news dataset and built a deep learning model (Bi - LSTM) using GloVe embedding. Use data outside the training set to test the model's efficiency and make corresponding adjustments based on the results. Scraping news from the internet and using the model we got to test if the news is real and collect tweets from Twitter that discuss the news. Use ANEWS as the dictionary to analyze tweets' emotions and see the impact fake news has on people's emotions.
